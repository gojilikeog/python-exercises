# python-exercises

This is a compilation of Python exercises + solutions that'll be compiled on one file for reference.
It is meant to be able to reference at a later date, instead of saving it locally, or to have one
long running .py file. If the need ever arises that I need to refer to a previous exercise.
These exercises are published on practicepython.org.

This will also serve as a reference point of developed skill. At the time of this edit, I am currently
relearning Python after finishing a course in Java - Data Structures & Algorithms. We'll see where
upon the next revision.
